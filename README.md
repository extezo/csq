# CSQ Database

<p align="justify"> Video databases with a set of subjective scores form an important basis for learning algorithms, testing and creating an objective assessment of video quality. This paper presents a new video database with a set of subjective scores to test the quality of encoded video, using finding an acceptable minimum perceptual threshold that generates video sequences of constant quality. The new video database with a set of subjective scores, represents video sequences of constant quality, generated using dynamically changing visual quality of typical media content during the examination process. This approach would produce well-labeled data in a larger volume compared to the currently used binary evaluations. New databases with this approach can be used to create both efficient adaptive codecs based on a hybrid model and new ones based on machine learning.

<p align="justify">The figure below shows sample frames from the reference video sequence. The video sequence for the database was professionally recorded in digital format, which makes it possible to make distortions in the video and to subject the video to several processing steps, both on the device itself and on the server.
